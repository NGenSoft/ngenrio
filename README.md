This little slice of code(s) is set to act as a very basic, very straightforward set of related and interworking pieces:

1.) A Node.js HTTP server for serving up static file assets based on a predetermined list of MIME types
2.) HTML5 boilerplate, already set and configured to work seamlessly with the Node server
3.) jQuery and a quick little code snippet that pulls in a JSONP stream from Twitter based on a user's given username, and displays a varied-length list of tweets and their profile picture

Nothing too crazy! If you're experimenting with using Node as an HTTP server to host primarily static-content websites, this might be useful for you to look at, read the comments, and dissect.

By all means, use it in any way you see fit! Enjoy!
